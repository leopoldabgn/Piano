# Piano
This project allows you to play the piano on a computer. It is composed of a graphical interface coded in Java with the Java Swing library.

## How to install
You can download the last release and launch the piano.jar (you need to have Java13 or better) :
```
java -jar piano.jar
```
Or, you can download the repository and try to compile it yourself :
```
./run.sh
```
BUT you need to have maven installed and minimum Java13.  
  
If you have a version lower than Java13, you can try to change the version number in the pom.xml and rerun the command to compile again.

## How to use
Play piano:
- Mouse: you can click on the keys. In addition, to access the non-visible keys you can drag the blue rectangle at the top of the window from left to right.

- Keyboard: If you have an AZERTY keyboard, then the lowest key is A. The keys are then more and more acute going from left to right
